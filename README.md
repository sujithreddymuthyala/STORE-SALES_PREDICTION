## Problem Statement  
To run buisnesses successfully,Shopping malls and Big Marts keep track of individual item sales data in order to forecast future client demand. Customer information and product details are used to predict future sales.


## Dataset Description
We have train (8523) and test (5681) data set, train data set has both input and output variable(s). We need to predict the sales for test data set.

Item_Identifier: Unique product ID

Item_Weight: Weight of product

Item_Fat_Content: Whether the product is low fat or not

Item_Visibility: The % of total display area of all products in a store allocated to the particular product

Item_Outlet_Sales: Sales of the product in the particulat store. This is the outcome variable to be predicted.  

## Work Flow  
1) Importing the data.  
2) Checking data.  
3) Cleaning the data.  
4) Working on data for better understanding.  
5) Model Building  
6) Tuning Model.  
7) Saving the Model.    
8) Deployment.
