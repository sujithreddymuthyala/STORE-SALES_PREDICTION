## Problem Statement  
To run buisness successfully,Shopping malls and Big Marts keep track of individual item sales data in order to forecast future client demand. Customer information and product details are used to predict future sales.In a data warehouse, these data stores hold a significant amount of consumer information and particular item details. By mining the data store from the data warehouse, more
anomalies and common patterns can be discovered.


## Dataset Description
We have train (8523) and test (5681) data set, train data set has both input and output variable(s). We need to predict the sales for test data set.

Item_Identifier: Unique product ID

Item_Weight: Weight of product

Item_Fat_Content: Whether the product is low fat or not

Item_Visibility: The % of total display area of all products in a store allocated to the particular product

Item_Type: The category to which the product belongs

Item_MRP: Maximum Retail Price (list price) of the product

Outlet_Identifier: Unique store ID

Outlet_Establishment_Year: The year in which store was established

Outlet_Size: The size of the store in terms of ground area covered

Outlet_Location_Type: The type of city in which the store is located

Outlet_Type: Whether the outlet is just a grocery store or some sort of supermarket

Item_Outlet_Sales: Sales of the product in the particulat store. This is the outcome variable to be predicted.  

## Work Flow  
1) Importing the data.  
2) Checking data.  
3) Cleaning the data.  
4) Working on data for better understanding.  
5) Model Building  
6) Tuning Model.  
7) Saving the Model.    
8) Deployment.
